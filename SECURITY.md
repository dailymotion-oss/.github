# DAILYMOTION’S VULNERABILITY DISCLOSURE POLICY


## Introduction

Capitalized terms used in this vulnerability disclosure policy (“Policy”) and not otherwise defined have the meaning ascribed to such terms in our [Terms of Use](https://www.dailymotion.com/legal/terms?localization=us).

Security is one of Dailymotion’s core values. We highly value the time and effort invested in good faith by security researchers in helping us build a more secure platform for our partners and users. As such, we encourage the responsible disclosure of vulnerabilities related to Dailymotion’s products, websites and APIs. This Policy sets out the rules under which we expect the research and reporting of vulnerabilities to be conducted, as well as what you can expect from us in return.

If you are a security researcher and have discovered a security vulnerability in the Services, we appreciate your help in disclosing it to us in a responsible manner.

If you would like to report a security issue, you may do so using any of the following channels:

- Our public [Bug Bounty Program](https://bountyfactory.io/dailymotion/dailymotion-public-bug-bounty); please make sure you review the program rules before submitting in order to know if your submission is eligible for a reward;
- An email addressed to [security@dailymotion.com](security@dailymotion.com).

## Ground rules

In order to avoid any confusion between good-faith security research and fraudulent or malicious behaviors, we ask you to comply with the following rules when looking for, testing and reporting vulnerabilities:

- Take all reasonable measures to only interact with test accounts you have created on the platform;
- Do not use physical attacks on our security, social engineering, distributed denial of service, spam or applications of third parties;
- If you manage to gain unauthorized access to any data or systems, limit the amount of data or privileges you gain access to, to only the minimum required for effectively demonstrating a proof of concept. Also, cease testing and submit a report immediately if you encounter any personally identifiable information or proprietary information during testing. When in doubt, we will rate the vulnerability severity based on the worst case scenario;
- Avoid violating the privacy of others, disrupting our systems, destroying data, or harming user experience;
- Report any vulnerability you’ve discovered promptly (i.e. within days, not weeks). Do not take advantage of the vulnerability or problem;
- Only use the specified communication channels listed below to discuss or report vulnerability information to us and provide sufficient information so we will be able to resolve the vulnerability as quickly as possible (see Section 8 below for further information);
- Do not disclose vulnerabilities you've discovered publicly or to any third party until we have formally authorized you to do so in writing;
- Obviously do not engage in any fraudulent exploitation of the vulnerability, in any form, with us, our partners or our users.

## Communication

If you think you’ve found a vulnerability, please do not publicly disclose these details outside of this process without explicit permission. Please include the following details with your report and be as descriptive as possible:

- Vulnerability Location & Type - The exact location (vulnerable URLs and parameters) and the nature of the vulnerability;
- Steps to Reproduce - A detailed description of the steps required to reproduce the vulnerability (screenshots, compressed screen recordings, and proof-of-concept scripts are all helpful); and
- Attack Scenario - A relevant example attack scenario explaining the prerequisites to the attack, and its exact impact in a realistic context.

## Expectations

When working with us according to this Policy, you can expect us to:

- Work with you to understand and evaluate your report, including an initial response to the report within 96 hours of the report's submission;
- Work to remedy discovered vulnerabilities in a timely manner;
- Consider your submission in the context of the Bug Bounty Program, irrespective of if you have initially reported the issue through the Bug Bounty Program's platform.
- If interested in the Bug Bounty Program, please make sure that you have read and understood the scope of vulnerabilities which qualify for our reward program prior to submitting a report.
- Please note that our Bug Bounty Program may not be able to issue rewards to individuals who are located in countries where we are prohibited by law from making payments, such as countries on the EU or US sanctions lists.
- Handle your report with confidentiality and respect written requests for anonymity.
- Please note that if your submission is eligible for our reward program, the payment process will require you to disclose your identity to our Bug Bounty Program's payment partner, for legal reasons.

## Legal Matters

When conducting vulnerability research in good faith and in accordance with the terms specified in this Policy, we consider this research to be:

- Lawful and in accordance with applicable state laws relating to computer fraud. We will not bring any claim against you for circumvention of technology controls;
- Exempt from restrictions in our [Terms of Use](https://www.dailymotion.com/legal/terms?localization=us) only to the extent that they would interfere with conducting security research.

We won’t take legal action against, suspend, or terminate access to the Service for those who discover and report security vulnerabilities responsibly. Dailymotion reserves all of its legal rights in the event of any noncompliance.

If at any time you have concerns or are uncertain whether your security research is consistent with this Policy, please submit a report through one of our above mentioned communication channels (in Section 8) before going any further.
